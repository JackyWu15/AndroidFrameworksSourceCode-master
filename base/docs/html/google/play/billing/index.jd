  <h2><strong>New in In-App Billing</strong></h2>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>IAB v2 shutdown</strong>&mdash;In-app Billing v2 API is deprecated and will be shut down in January 2015. If your app is still using In-app Billing v2, please migrate to the v3 API as soon as possible.</li>
  <li><strong>Seasonal subscriptions</strong>&mdash;You can now set up a
    recurring <a href="billing_subscriptions.html#user-billing">seasonal
    subscription</a> that starts and ends on the same date each year (for
    example, a sports subscription that starts every September 1 and ends every
    April 10).</li>
  <li><strong>Deferred subscription billing</strong>&mdash;You can
    <a href="billing_subscriptions.html#deferred-billing">defer</a> a
    subscriber's next billing date until the date you choose. The user still has
    access to the content but is not charged during the deferral period.</li>
  <li><strong>Google Play Developer API</strong>&mdash;The
    <a href="{@docRoot}google/play/billing/gp-purchase-status-api.html">Google
    Play Developer API</a> allows you to perform a number of publishing and
    app-management tasks. It includes the functionality previously known as the
    <em>Purchase Status API.</em> </li>
  <li><strong>Refund/Revoke subscription</strong>&mdash;You can use the
    Google Play Developer API to <a href="billing_subscriptions.html#refunds">refund
    and revoke</a> a user's subscription. If you do this, the user's
    subscription ends
    immediately, and his or her most recent subscription payment is
    refunded.</li>
  <li><strong>In-app Billing Version 3</strong>&mdash;The <a href="{@docRoot}google/play/billing/api.html">latest version</a> of In-app Billing features a synchronous API that is easier to implement and lets you manage in-app products and subscriptions more effectively.</li>

<p>When you use the in-app billing service to sell an item,
whether it's an in-app product or a subscription, Google Play
handles all checkout details so your application never has to directly process
any financial transactions. Google Play uses the same checkout backend service as
is used for application purchases, so your users experience a consistent and
familiar purchase flow.</p>

<p>Any application that you publish through Google Play can implement In-app Billing. No special
account or registration is required other than a Google Play Developer Console account and a Google
Wallet merchant account.</p>

<p>To help you integrate in-app billing into your application, the Android SDK
provides a sample application that demonstrates how to sell standard in-app
products and subscriptions from inside an app.</p>
