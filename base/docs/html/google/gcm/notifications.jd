<p>With user notifications, 3rd-party app servers can send a single message to
multiple instance of an app running on devices owned by a single user. This feature
is called <em>user notifications</em>. User notifications make it possible for every
app instance that a user owns to reflect the latest messaging state. For example:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>If a message has been handled on one device, the GCM message on the other
devices are dismissed. For example, if a user has handled a calendar notification
on one device, the notification will go away on the user's other devices.</li>

  <li>If a message has not been delivered yet to a device and but it has been handled,
the GCM server removes it from the unsent queue for the other devices.</li>

  <li>Likewise, a device can send messages to the {@code notification_key}, which
is the token that GCM uses to fan out notifications to all devices whose
registration IDs are associated with the key.</li>
</ul>

<p>The way this works is that during registration, the 3rd-party server requests
a {@code notification_key}. The {@code notification_key} maps a particular user
to all of the user's associated registration IDs (a regID represents a particular
Android application running on a particular device). Then instead of sending one
message to one regID at a time, the 3rd-party server can send a message to to the
{@code notification_key}, which then sends the message to all of the user's regIDs.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> A notification dismissal message is like any
other upstream message, meaning that it will be delivered to the other devices that
belong to the specified {@code notification_key}. You should design your app to
handle cases where the app receives a dismissal message, but has not yet displayed
the notification that is being dismissed. You can solve this by caching the dismissal
and then reconciling it with the corresponding notification.
</p>

<p>You can use this feature with either the <a href="ccs.html">XMPP</a> (CCS) or
<a href="http.html">HTTP</a> connection server.</p>

<p>You can generate notification keys in two different ways: on the server, and on
the client, if the user has a Google account. All of the associated registration IDs
can be mapped to a single user.</p>

<p>The examples below show you how to perform generate/add/remove operations,
and how to send upstream messages. For generate/add/remove operations, the
message body is JSON.</p>

<h2 id="gen-server">Generate a Notification Key on the Server</h2>

<p>To generate a notification key on the server, you create a new
create a new <code>notification_key</code> and map it to a
<code>notification_key_name</code>.</p>

<p>This example shows how to create a new <code>notification_key</code> for a
<code>notification_key_name</code> called <code>appUser-Chris</code>.
The {@code notification_key_name} is a name or identifier (it can be a username for
a 3rd-party app) that is unique to a given user. It is used by third parties to
group together registration IDs for a single user. Note that <code>notification_key_name</code>
and <code>notification_key</code> are unique to a group of registration IDs. It is also
important that <code>notification_key_name</code> be uniquely named per app in case
you have multiple apps for the same project ID. This ensures that notifications
only go to the intended target app.</p>


<p>A create operation returns a token (<code>notification_key</code>). Third parties
must save this token (as well as its mapping to the <code>notification_key_name</code>)
to use in subsequent operations:</p>

<pre>request:
{ 
   &quot;operation&quot;: &quot;create&quot;,
   &quot;notification_key_name&quot;: &quot;appUser-Chris&quot;,
   &quot;registration_ids&quot;: [&quot;4&quot;, &quot;8&quot;, &quot;15&quot;, &quot;16&quot;, &quot;23&quot;, &quot;42&quot;]
}</pre>

<h3 id="request-server">Request format</h3>

<p>To send a message in cases where your notification key is generated on the server,
the application server issues a POST request to
<code>https://android.googleapis.com/gcm/notification</code>.</p>

<p>Here is the HTTP request header you should use for all server side create/add/remove operations:</p>

<pre>content-type: "application/json"
Header : "project_id": &lt;projectID&gt;
Header: "Authorization", "key=API_KEY"
</pre>


<h2 id="gen-client">Generate a Notification Key on the Client</h2>

<p>Generating a notification key on the client is useful for cases where a server is unavailable.
To generate a notification key on the client, the device must have at least one
Google account. Note that the process for generating a notification key on the client is significantly
different from the server process described above.</p>

<p>To generate a notification key on the client:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open your project in the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/console">Google Developers Console</a>.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>APIS &amp; AUTH &gt; Credentials</strong>.</li>
  <li>Under OAuth, click <strong>Create new Client ID</strong>.</li>
  <li>In the <strong>Create Client ID</strong> dialog, select <strong>Web Application</strong> as
the application type, and click <strong>Create Client ID</strong>.</li>
  <li>Copy the value from <strong>Client ID for web application &gt; Client ID</strong>.
This client ID represents a Google account "scope" that you will use to generate an {@code id_token}.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once you've followed the above steps and gotten a client ID from Google Developers Console,
 you're ready to add this feature to your app. First check the device for the presence of a Google
account. For example:</p>

<pre>// This snippet takes the simple approach of using the first returned Google account,
// but you can pick any Google account on the device.
public String getAccount() {
    Account[] accounts = AccountManager.get(getActivity()).
        getAccountsByType(&quot;com.google&quot;);
    if (accounts.length == 0) {
        return null;
    }
    return accounts[0].name;
}</pre>

<p>Next, get an authentication token ({@code id_token}) by using the <code><a href=
"http://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/gms/auth/GoogleAuthUtil.html">GoogleAuthUtil</a></code>
class. For example:</p>

<pre>String accountName = getAccount();

// Initialize the scope using the client ID you got from the Console.
final String scope = &quot;audience:server:client_id:&quot;
        + &quot;1262xxx48712-9qs6n32447mcj9dirtnkyrejt82saa52.apps.googleusercontent.com&quot;;
String id_token = null;
try {
    id_token = GoogleAuthUtil.getToken(context, accountName, scope);
} catch (Exception e) {
    log(&quot;exception while getting id_token: &quot; + e);
}
...</pre>

<p>Now use <code>id_token</code> to authenticate your request.
This add operation returns a {@code notification_key}.
Third parties must save this {@code notification_key} (as well as its mapping to the
<code>notification_key_name</code>)
to use in subsequent operations. Note that a client request only takes a single regID.
The only operations supported on the client side are add/remove.</p>

<pre>request:
{
   &quot;operation&quot;: &quot;add&quot;,
   &quot;notification_key_name&quot;: &quot;appUser-Chris&quot;,
   &quot;registration_ids&quot;: [&quot;4&quot;]
   &quot;id_token&quot;: &quot;id_token&quot;
}</pre>

<h3 id="request-client">Request format</h3>

<p>To send a message in cases where your notification key is generated on the client,
the application server issues a POST request to
<code>https://android.googleapis.com/gcm/googlenotification</code>.</p>

<p>Here is the HTTP request header you should use for all add/remove operations. The
client side doesn't support the create operation;
the add operation has the effect of creating the notification key if it doesn't already
exist:</p>

<pre>content-type: "application/json"
Header : "project_id": &lt;projectID&gt;
</pre>

<p>Note that the authentication token is passed in the JSON body as shown above, not the header.
This is different from the server case.</p>


<h2 id="add">Add Registration IDs</h2>

<p>This example shows how to add registration IDs for a given notification key.
The maximum number of members allowed for a {@code notification_key} is 20.</p>

<p>Note that the <code>notification_key_name</code> is not strictly required for
adding/removing regIDs. But including it protects you against accidentally using
the incorrect <code>notification_key</code>.</p>

<pre>request:
{ 
   &quot;operation&quot;: &quot;add&quot;,
   &quot;notification_key_name&quot;: &quot;appUser-Chris&quot;,
   &quot;notification_key&quot;: &quot;aUniqueKey&quot;
   &quot;registration_ids&quot;: [&quot;4&quot;, &quot;8&quot;, &quot;15&quot;, &quot;16&quot;, &quot;23&quot;, &quot;42&quot;]
}</pre>

<h2 id="remove">Remove Registration IDs</h2>

<p>This example shows how to remove registration IDs for a given notification key:</p>
<pre>request:
{ 
   &quot;operation&quot;: &quot;remove&quot;,
   &quot;notification_key_name&quot;: &quot;appUser-Chris&quot;,
   &quot;notification_key&quot;: &quot;aUniqueKey&quot;
   &quot;registration_ids&quot;: [&quot;4&quot;, &quot;8&quot;, &quot;15&quot;, &quot;16&quot;, &quot;23&quot;, &quot;42&quot;]
}</pre>

<h2 id="upstream">Send Upstream Messages</h2>

<p>To send an upstream (device-to-cloud) message, you must use the
<a href="{@docRoot}reference/com/google/android/gms/gcm/GoogleCloudMessaging.html">
{@code GoogleCloudMessaging}</a> API. Specifying a {@code notification_key} as the target
for an upstream message allows a user on one device to send a message to other
devices in the notification group&mdash;for example, to dismiss a notification.
Here is an example that shows targeting a {@code notification_key}:</p>

<pre>GoogleCloudMessaging gcm = GoogleCloudMessaging.get(context);
String to = NOTIFICATION_KEY;
AtomicInteger msgId = new AtomicInteger();
String id = Integer.toString(msgId.incrementAndGet());
Bundle data = new Bundle();
data.putString("hello", "world");

gcm.send(to, id, data);
</pre>

<p>This call generates the necessary XMPP stanza for sending the message. The
Bundle data consists of a key-value pair.</p>

<p>For a complete example, see <a href="client.html">Implementing GCM Client</a>.

<h2 id="response">Response Formats</h2>

<p>This section shows examples of the responses that can be returned for
notification key operations.</p>

<h3 id="response-create">Create/add/remove operations</h3>

<p>When you make a request to create a {@code notification_key} or to add/remove its
regIDs, a successful response always returns the <code>notification_key</code>.
his is the {@code notification_key} you will use for sending messages:</p>

<pre>HTTP status: 200
{ 
    &quot;notification_key&quot;: &quot;aUniqueKey&quot;,   // to be used for sending
}</pre>


<h3 id="response-send">Send operations</h3>

<p>For a send operation that has a {@code notification_key} as its target, the
possible responses are success, partial success, and failure.</p>

<p>Here is an example of "success"&mdash;the {@code notification_key} has 2 regIDs
associated with it, and the message was successfully sent to both of them:</p>

<pre>{
  "success": 2,
  "failure": 0
}</pre>

<p>Here is an example of "partial success"&mdash;the {@code notification_key} has
3 regIDs associated with it. The message was successfully send to 1 of the regIDs,
but not to the other 2. The response message lists the regIDs that failed to
receive the message:</p>

<pre>{
  "success":1,
  "failure":2,
  "failed_registration_ids":[
     "regId1",
     "regId2"
  ]
}</pre>

<p>In the case of failure, the response has HTTP code 503 and no JSON. When a message
fails to be delivered to one or more of the regIDs associated with a {@code notification_key},
the 3rd-party server should retry.</p>
