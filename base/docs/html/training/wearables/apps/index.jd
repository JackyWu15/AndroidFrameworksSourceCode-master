Wearable apps run directly on the device, giving you access to hardware such as sensors and the
GPU. They are fundamentally the same as apps built for other devices using the Android SDK, but
differ greatly in design and usability and the amount of functionality provided.
These are the main differences between handheld and wearable apps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The system enforces a timeout period. If you are displaying an activity and user's don't
  interact with it, the device sleeps. When it wakes back up, the Wear home screen is displayed
  instead of your activity. If you need to show something persistent, create a notification in the
  context stream instead.</li>
  <li>Wearable apps are relatively small in size and functionality compared to handheld apps.
  They contain only what makes sense on the wearable, which is usually a small
  subset of the corresponding handheld app. In general, you should carry out operations on the
  handheld when possible and send the results to the wearable.
  </li>
  <li>Users don't download apps directly onto the wearable. Instead, you bundle
  the wearable app inside the handheld app. When users install the handheld app,
  the system automatically installs the wearable app. However, for development
  purposes, you can still install the wearable app directly to the wearable.</li>
  <li><p>Wearable apps can access much of the standard Android APIs, but don't support
  the following APIs:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>{@link android.webkit}</li>
    <li>{@link android.print}</li>
    <li>{@link android.app.backup}</li>
    <li>{@link android.appwidget}</li>
    <li>{@link android.hardware.usb}</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  You can check if a wearable supports a feature by calling
  {@link android.content.pm.PackageManager#hasSystemFeature hasSystemFeature()}
  before trying to use an API.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p class="note"><b>Note:</b> We recommend using Android Studio for Android Wear development
as it provides project setup, library inclusion, and packaging conveniences that aren't available
in ADT. The rest of this training assumes you're using Android Studio.
