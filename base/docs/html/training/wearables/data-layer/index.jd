    <ul>
      <li>Android 4.3 (API Level 18) or higher on the handset device</li>
      <li>The latest version of <a href="{@docRoot}google/play">Google Play services</a></li>
      <li>An Android Wear device or Wear AVD</li>

<p>
The Wearable Data Layer API, which is part of Google Play services, provides a communication channel
for your handheld and wearable apps. The API consists of a set of data objects that the system can
send and synchronize over the wire and listeners that notify your apps of important events with
the data layer:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><b>Data Items</b></dt>
  <dd>A <a href="{@docRoot}reference/com/google/android/gms/wearable/DataItem.html"><code>DataItem</code></a>
  provides data storage with automatic syncing between the handheld and
  wearable.</dd>

  <dt><b>Messages</b></dt>
  <dd>The <a href="{@docRoot}reference/com/google/android/gms/wearable/MessageApi.html"><code>MessageApi</code></a> class
  can send messages and is good for remote procedure calls (RPC), such as controlling a handheld's
  media player from the wearable or starting an intent on the wearable from the handheld.
  The system always delivers the message when the handheld and wearable are connected and delivers
  an error when the devices are disconnected. Messages are great for one-way requests or for a
  request/response communication model.</dd>

  <dt><b>Asset</b></dt>
  <dd><a href="{@docRoot}reference/com/google/android/gms/wearable/Asset.html"><code>Asset</code></a> objects are for
  sending binary blobs of data, such as images. You attach assets to data items and the system
  automatically takes care of the transfer for you, conserving Bluetooth bandwidth by caching large assets
  to avoid re-transmission.</dd>

  <dt><b>WearableListenerService</b> (for services)</dt>
  <dd><p>Extending <a href="{@docRoot}reference/com/google/android/gms/wearable/WearableListenerService.html"><code>WearableListenerService</code></a>
  lets you listen for important data layer events in a service. The system manages the lifecycle of
  the <a href="{@docRoot}reference/com/google/android/gms/wearable/WearableListenerService.html"><code>WearableListenerService</code></a>,
  binding to the service when it needs to send data items or messages and unbinding the service when no work is needed.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt><b>DataListener</b> (for foreground activities)</dt>
  <dd>
  Implementing <a href="{@docRoot}reference/com/google/android/gms/wearable/DataApi.DataListener.html"><code>DataListener</code></a>
  in an activity lets you listen for important data layer events when an activity
  is in the foreground. Using this instead of the
  <a href="{@docRoot}reference/com/google/android/gms/wearable/WearableListenerService.html"><code>WearableListenerService</code></a>
  lets you listen for changes only when the user is actively using your app.
  </dd>
</dl>

<p class="warning"><b>Warning:</b>
Because these APIs are designed for communication between handhelds and wearables,
these are the only APIs you should use to set up communication between these
devices. For instance, don't try to open low-level sockets to create a communication
channel.
