<p>Playing videos and music is a popular activity on Android devices. The Android framework
  provides {@link android.media.MediaPlayer} as a quick solution for playing media with minimal
  code, and the {@link android.media.MediaCodec} and {@link android.media.MediaExtractor} classes
  are provided for building custom media players. The open source project, ExoPlayer, is a
  solution between these two options, providing a pre-built player that you can extend.</p>

<p>ExoPlayer supports features not currently provided by
  {@link android.media.MediaPlayer}, including Dynamic adaptive streaming
  over HTTP (DASH), SmoothStreaming, and persistent caching. ExoPlayer can be extended
  to handle additional media formats, and because you include it as part of your app code,
  you can update it along with your app.</p>

<p>This guide describes how to use ExoPlayer for playing Android supported media formats, as well as
  DASH and SmoothStreaming playback. This guide also discusses ExoPlayer events, messages, DRM
  support and guidelines for customizing the player.</p>

<p class="note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> ExoPlayer is an open source project that is not part of the Android
  framework and is distributed separately from the Android SDK. The project contains a library and
  a demo app that shows both simple and more advanced use of ExoPlayer:</p>

</ul>


<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>ExoPlayer is a media player built on top of the {@link android.media.MediaExtractor} and
  {@link android.media.MediaCodec} APIs released in Android 4.1 (API level 16). At the core of this
  library is the {@code ExoPlayer} class. This class maintains the player’s global state, but makes few
  assumptions about the nature of the media being played, such as how the media data is obtained,
  how it is buffered or its format. You inject this functionality through ExoPlayer’s {@code
  prepare()} method in the form of {@code TrackRenderer} objects.</p>

<p>ExoPlayer provides default {@code TrackRenderer} implementations for audio and
  video, which make use of the {@link android.media.MediaCodec} and {@link android.media.AudioTrack}
  classes in the Android framework. Both renderers require a {@code SampleSource} object, from which
  they obtain individual media samples for playback. Figure 1 shows the high level object model for
  an ExoPlayer implementation configured to play audio and video using these components.</p>

<img src="{@docRoot}images/exoplayer/object-model.png" alt="" id="figure1" />
<p class="img-caption">
  <strong>Figure 1.</strong> High level object model for an ExoPlayer configured to play audio
  and video using {@code TrackRenderer} objects
</p>


<h2 id="trackrenderer">TrackRenderer</h2>

<p>A {@code TrackRenderer} processes a component of media for playback, such as
  video, audio or text. The ExoPlayer class invokes methods on its {@code TrackRenderer} instances from a
  single playback thread, and by doing so causes each media component to be rendered as the global
  playback position is advanced. The ExoPlayer library provides {@code MediaCodecVideoTrackRenderer} as
  the default implementations rendering video and {@code MediaCodecAudioTrackRenderer} for audio.
  Both implementations make use of {@link android.media.MediaCodec} to decode individual media
  samples. They can handle all audio and video formats supported by a given Android device
  (see <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/appendix/media-formats.html">Supported Media
  Formats</a> for details). The ExoPlayer library also provides an implementation for rendering
  text called {@code TextTrackRenderer}.
</p>

<p>The code example below outlines the main steps required to instantiate an ExoPlayer to play video
  and audio using the standard {@code TrackRenderer} implementations.</p>

<pre>
// 1. Instantiate the player.
player = ExoPlayer.Factory.newInstance(RENDERER_COUNT);
// 2. Construct renderers.
MediaCodecVideoTrackRenderer videoRenderer = …
MediaCodecAudioTrackRenderer audioRenderer = ...
// 3. Inject the renderers through prepare.
player.prepare(videoRenderer, audioRenderer);
// 4. Pass the surface to the video renderer.
player.sendMessage(videoRenderer, MediaCodecVideoTrackRenderer.MSG_SET_SURFACE,
        surface);
// 5. Start playback.
player.setPlayWhenReady(true);
...
player.release(); // Don’t forget to release when done!
</pre>

<p>For a complete example, see the {@code SimplePlayerActivity} in the ExoPlayer demo app, which
  correctly manages an ExoPlayer instance with respect to both the {@link android.app.Activity} and
  {@link android.view.Surface} lifecycles.</p>


<h2 id="samplesource">SampleSource</h2>

<p>A standard {@code TrackRenderer} implementation requires a {@code SampleSource} to
  be provided in its constructor. A {@code SampleSource} object provides format information and
  media samples to be rendered. The ExoPlayer library provides {@code FrameworkSampleSource} and
  {@code ChunkSampleSource}. The {@code FrameworkSampleSource} class uses {@link
  android.media.MediaExtractor} to request, buffer and extract the media samples. The {@code
  ChunkSampleSource} class provides adaptive playback using DASH or SmoothStreaming, and
  implements networking, buffering and media extraction within the ExoPlayer library.</p>


<h3 id="mediaextractor">Providing media using MediaExtractor</h3>

<p>
  In order to render media formats supported by the Android framework, the {@code
  FrameworkSampleSource} class uses {@link android.media.MediaExtractor} for networking,
  buffering and sample extraction functionality. By doing so, it supports any media container format
  supported by the version of Android where it is running. For more information about media formats
  supported by Android, see <a href="{@docRoot}guide/appendix/media-formats.html">Supported
  Media Formats</a>.
</p>

<p>The diagram in Figure 2 shows the object model for an ExoPlayer implementation using
  {@code FrameworkSampleSource}.</p>

<img src="{@docRoot}images/exoplayer/frameworksamplesource.png" alt="" id="figure2" />
<p class="img-caption">
  <strong>Figure 2.</strong> Object model for an implementation of ExoPlayer that renders
  media formats supported by Android using {@code FrameworkSampleSource}
</p>

<p>The following code example outlines how the video and audio renderers are constructed to
  load the video from a specified URI.</p>

<pre>
FrameworkSampleSource sampleSource = new FrameworkSampleSource(
        activity, uri, null, 2);
MediaCodecVideoTrackRenderer videoRenderer = new MediaCodecVideoTrackRenderer(
        sampleSource, null, true, MediaCodec.VIDEO_SCALING_MODE_SCALE_TO_FIT, 0,
        mainHandler, playerActivity, 50);
MediaCodecAudioTrackRenderer audioRenderer = new MediaCodecAudioTrackRenderer(
        sampleSource, null, true);
</pre>

<p>The ExoPlayer demo app provides a complete implementation of this code in
  {@code DefaultRendererBuilder}. The {@code SimplePlaybackActivity} class uses it to play one
  of the videos available in the demo app. Note that in the example, video and audio
  are muxed, meaning they are streamed together from a single URI. The {@code FrameworkSampleSource}
  instance provides video samples to the {@code videoRenderer} object and audio samples to the
  {@code audioRenderer} object as they are extracted from the media container format. It is also
  possible to play demuxed media, where video and audio are streamed separately from different URIs.
  This functionality can be achieved by having two {@code FrameworkSampleSource} instances instead
  of one.</p>


<h3 id="adaptive-playback">Providing media for adaptive playback</h3>

<p>ExoPlayer supports adaptive streaming, which allows the quality of the
  media data to be adjusted during playback based on the network conditions. DASH
  and SmoothStreaming are examples of adaptive streaming technologies. Both these approaches
  load media in small chunks (typically 2 to 10 seconds in duration). Whenever a chunk of media
  is requested, the client selects from a number of possible formats. For example, a client may
  select a high quality format if network conditions are good, or a low quality format if network
  conditions are bad. In both techniques, video and audio are streamed separately.</p>

<p>ExoPlayer supports adaptive playback through use of the {@code ChunkSampleSource} class,
  which loads chunks of media data from which individual samples can be extracted. Each {@code
  ChunkSampleSource} requires a {@code ChunkSource} object to be injected through its constructor,
  which is responsible for providing media chunks from which to load and read samples. The {@code
  DashMp4ChunkSource} and {@code SmoothStreamingChunkSource} classes provide DASH and SmoothStreaming
  playback using the FMP4 container format. The {@code DashWebMChunkSource} class uses the WebM
  container format to provide DASH playback.</p>

<p>All of the standard {@code ChunkSource} implementations require a {@code FormatEvaluator} and
  a {@code DataSource} to be injected through their constructors. The {@code FormatEvaluator}
  objects select from the available formats before each chunk is loaded. The {@code DataSource}
  objects are responsible for actually loading the data. Finally, the {@code ChunkSampleSources}
  require a {@code LoadControl} object that controls the chunk buffering policy.</p>

<p>The object model of an ExoPlayer configured for a DASH adaptive playback is shown in the
  diagram below. This example uses an {@code HttpDataSource} object to stream the media over the
  network. The video quality is varied at runtime using the adaptive implementation of {@code
  FormatEvaluator}, while audio is played at a fixed quality level.</p>

<img src="{@docRoot}images/exoplayer/adaptive-streaming.png" alt="" id="figure3" />
<p class="img-caption">
  <strong>Figure 3.</strong> Object model for a DASH adaptive playback using ExoPlayer
</p>

<p>The following code example outlines how the video and audio renderers are constructed.</p>

<pre>
Handler mainHandler = playerActivity.getMainHandler();
LoadControl loadControl = new DefaultLoadControl(
        new BufferPool(BUFFER_SEGMENT_SIZE));
BandwidthMeter bandwidthMeter = new BandwidthMeter();

// Build the video renderer.
DataSource videoDataSource = new HttpDataSource(userAgent,
        HttpDataSource.REJECT_PAYWALL_TYPES, bandwidthMeter);
ChunkSource videoChunkSource = new DashMp4ChunkSource(videoDataSource,
        new AdaptiveEvaluator(bandwidthMeter), videoRepresentations);
ChunkSampleSource videoSampleSource = new ChunkSampleSource(videoChunkSource,
        loadControl, VIDEO_BUFFER_SEGMENTS * BUFFER_SEGMENT_SIZE, true);
MediaCodecVideoTrackRenderer videoRenderer = new MediaCodecVideoTrackRenderer(
        videoSampleSource, null, true, MediaCodec.VIDEO_SCALING_MODE_SCALE_TO_FIT,
        0, mainHandler, playerActivity, 50);

// Build the audio renderer.
DataSource audioDataSource = new HttpDataSource(userAgent,
        HttpDataSource.REJECT_PAYWALL_TYPES, bandwidthMeter);
ChunkSource audioChunkSource = new DashMp4ChunkSource(audioDataSource,
        new FormatEvaluator.FixedEvaluator(), audioRepresentation);
SampleSource audioSampleSource = new ChunkSampleSource(audioChunkSource,
        loadControl, AUDIO_BUFFER_SEGMENTS * BUFFER_SEGMENT_SIZE, true);
MediaCodecAudioTrackRenderer audioRenderer = new MediaCodecAudioTrackRenderer(
        audioSampleSource, null, true);
</pre>

<p>In this code, {@code videoRepresentations} and {@code audioRepresentation} are {@code
  Representation} objects, each of which describes one of the available media streams. In the DASH
  model, these streams are parsed from a media presentation description (MPD) file. The ExoPlayer
  library provides a {@code MediaPresentationDescriptionParser} class to obtain {@code
  Representation} objects from MPD files.</p>

<p class="note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> Building Representation objects from MPD files is not required. You can
  build Representation objects from other data sources if necessary.
</p>

<p>The ExoPlayer demo app provides complete implementation of this code in
  {@code DashVodRendererBuilder}. The {@code SimplePlaybackActivity} class uses this builder to
  construct renderers for playing DASH sample videos in the demo app. It asynchronously fetches a
  specified MPD file in order to construct the required {@code Representation} objects. For an
  equivalent SmoothStreaming example, see the {@code SmoothStreamingRendererBuilder} class in the
  demo app.</p>


<h4 id="format-selection">Format selection for adaptive playback</h4>

<p>For DASH and SmoothStreaming playback, consider both static format selection at the
  start of playback and dynamic format selection during playback. Static format selection should be
  used to filter out formats that should not be used throughout the playback, for example formats
  with resolutions higher than the maximum supported by the playback device. Dynamic selection varies
  the selected format during playback, typically to adapt video quality in response to changes in
  network conditions.</p>

<h5 id="static-selection">Static format selection</h5>

<p>When preparing a player, you should consider filtering out some of the available formats if
  they are not useable for playback. Static format selection allows you to filter out
  formats that cannot be used on a particular device or are not compatible with your player.
  For audio playback, this often means picking a single format to play and discarding the others.</p>

<p>For video playback, filtering formats can be more complicated. Apps should first
  eliminate any streams that whose resolution is too high to be played by the device. For H.264,
  which is normally used for DASH and SmoothStreaming playback, ExoPlayer’s {@code MediaCodecUtil}
  class provides a {@code maxH264DecodableFrameSize()} method that can be used to determine what
  resolution streams the device is able to handle, as shown in the following code example:</p>

<pre>
int maxDecodableFrameSize = MediaCodecUtil.maxH264DecodableFrameSize();
Format format = representation.format;
if (format.width * format.height &lt;= maxDecodableFrameSize) {
  // The device can play this stream.
  videoRepresentations.add(representation);
} else {
  // The device isn't capable of playing this stream.
}
</pre>

<p>This approach is used to filter {@code Representations} in the {@code DashVodRendererBuilder}
  class of the ExoPlayer demo app, and similarly to filter track indices in {@code
  SmoothStreamingRendererBuilder}.</p>

<p>In addition to eliminating unsupported formats, it should be noted that the ability to
  seamlessly switch between H.264 streams of different resolution is an optional decoder feature
  available in Android 4.3 (API level 16) and higher, and so is not supported by all devices. The
  availability of an adaptive H.264 decoder can be queried using {@code MediaCodecUtil}, as shown in
  the following code example:</p>

<pre>
boolean isAdaptive = MediaCodecUtil.getDecoderInfo(MimeTypes.VIDEO_H264).adaptive;
</pre>

<p>The {@code MediaCodecVideoTrackRenderer} class is still able to handle resolution changes on
  devices that do not have adaptive decoders, however the switch is not seamless. Typically, the
  switch creates a small discontinuity in visual output lasting around 50-100ms. For devices that
  do not provide an adaptive decoder, app developers may choose to adapt between formats at
  a single fixed resolution so as to avoid discontinuities. The ExoPlayer demo app
  implementation does not pick a fixed resolution.</p>


<h5 id="dynamic-selection">Dynamic format selection</h5>

<p>During playback, you can use a {@code FormatEvaluator} to dynamically select from the
  available video formats. The ExoPlayer library provides a {@code FormatEvaluator.Adaptive}
  implementation for dynamically selecting between video formats based on the current network
  conditions.</p>

<p>This class provides a simple, general purpose reference implementation, however you are
  encouraged to write your own {@code FormatEvaluator} implementation to best suit your particular
  needs.</p>


<h2 id="events">Player Events</h2>

<p>During playback, your app can listen for events generated by the ExoPlayer that indicate the
  overall state of the player. These events are useful as triggers for updating the app user
  interface such as playback controls. Many ExoPlayer components also report their own component
  specific low level events, which can be useful for performance monitoring.</p>


<h3 id="high-events">High level events</h3>

<p>ExoPlayer allows instances of {@code ExoPlayer.Listener} to be added and removed using its
  {@code addListener()} and {@code removeListener()} methods. Registered listeners are notified of
  changes in playback state, as well as when errors occur that cause playback to fail. For more
  information about the valid playback states and the possible transitions between them, see the
  ExoPlayer source code.</p>

<p>Developers who implement custom playback controls should register a listener and use it to
  update their controls as the player’s state changes. An app should also show an
  appropriate error to the user if playback fails.</p>

<h3 id="low-events">Low level events</h3>

<p>In addition to high level listeners, many of the individual components provided by the
  ExoPlayer library allow their own event listeners. For example, {@code
  MediaCodecVideoTrackRenderer} has constructors that take a {@code
  MediaCodecVideoTrackRenderer.EventListener}. In the ExoPlayer demo app, {@code SimplePlayerActivity}
  acts as a listener so that it can adjust the dimensions of the target surface to have the correct
  height and width ratio for the video being played:</p>

<pre>
&#64;Override
public void onVideoSizeChanged(int width, int height) {
  surfaceView.setVideoWidthHeightRatio(height == 0 ? 1 : (float) width / height);
}
</pre>

<p>The {@code RendererBuilder} classes in the ExoPlayer demo app inject the activity as the
  listener, for example in the {@code DashVodRendererBuilder} class:</p>

<pre>
MediaCodecVideoTrackRenderer videoRenderer = new MediaCodecVideoTrackRenderer(
        videoSampleSource, null, true, MediaCodec.VIDEO_SCALING_MODE_SCALE_TO_FIT,
        0, <strong>mainHandler, playerActivity</strong>, 50);
</pre>

<p>Note that you must pass a {@link android.os.Handler} object to the renderer, which determines
  the thread on which the listener’s methods are invoked. In most cases, you should use a
  {@link android.os.Handler} associated with the app’s main thread, as is the case in this example.
  </p>

<p>Listening to individual components can be useful for adjusting UI based on player events, as
  in the example above. Listening to component events can also be helpful for logging performance
  metrics. For example, {@code MediaCodecVideoTrackRenderer} notifies its listener of dropped video
  frames. A developer may wish to log such metrics to track playback performance in their
  app.</p>

<p>Many components also notify their listeners when errors occur. Such errors may or may not
  cause playback to fail. If an error does not cause playback to fail, it may still result in
  degraded performance, and so you may wish to log all errors in order to track playback
  performance. Note that an ExoPlayer instance always notifies its high level listeners of errors that
  cause playback to fail, in addition to the listener of the individual component from which the error
  originated. Hence, you should display error messages to users only from high level listeners.
  Within individual component listeners, you should use error notifications only for informational
  purposes.</p>


<h2 id="sending-messages">Sending messages to components</h2>

<p>Some ExoPlayer components allow changes in configuration during playback. By convention, you make
  these changes by passing asynchronous messages through the ExoPlayer to the component.
  This approach ensures both thread safety and that the configuration change is
  executed in order with any other operations being performed on the player.</p>

<p>The most common use of messaging is passing a target surface to
  {@code MediaCodecVideoTrackRenderer}:</p>

<pre>
player.sendMessage(videoRenderer, MediaCodecVideoTrackRenderer.MSG_SET_SURFACE,
        surface);
</pre>

<p>Note that if the surface needs to be cleared because
  {@link android.view.SurfaceHolder.Callback#surfaceDestroyed
  SurfaceHolder.Callback.surfaceDestroyed()} has been invoked, then you must send this
  message using the blocking variant of {@code sendMessage()}:</p>
<p>

<pre>
player.blockingSendMessage(videoRenderer,
        MediaCodecVideoTrackRenderer.MSG_SET_SURFACE, null);
</pre>

<p>You must use a blocking message because the contract of {@link
  android.view.SurfaceHolder.Callback#surfaceDestroyed surfaceDestroyed()} requires that the
  app does not attempt to access the surface after the method returns. The {@code
  SimplePlayerActivity} class in the demo app demonstrates how the surface should be set and
  cleared.</p>


<h2 id="customizing">Customizing ExoPlayer</h2>

<p>One of the main benefits of ExoPlayer over {@link android.media.MediaPlayer} is the ability to
  customize and extend the player to better suit the developer’s use case. The ExoPlayer library
  is designed specifically with this in mind, defining a number of abstract base classes and
  interfaces that make it possible for app developers to easily replace the default implementations
  provided by the library. Here are some use cases for building custom components:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>{@code TrackRenderer}</strong> - You may want to implement a custom
    {@code TrackRenderer} to handle media types other than audio and video. The {@code
    TextTrackRenderer} class within the ExoPlayer library is an example of how to implement a
    custom renderer. You could use the approach it demonstrates to render custom
    overlays or annotations. Implementing this kind of functionality as a {@code TrackRenderer}
    makes it easy to keep the overlays or annotations in sync with the other media being played.</li>
  <li><strong>{@code SampleSource}</strong> - If you need to support a container format not
    already handled by {@link android.media.MediaExtractor} or ExoPlayer, consider implementing a
    custom {@code SampleSource} class.</li>
  <li><strong>{@code FormatEvaluator}</strong> - The ExoPlayer library provides {@code
    FormatEvaluator.Adaptive} as a simple reference implementation that switches between different
    quality video formats based on the available bandwidth. App developers are encouraged to
    develop their own adaptive {@code FormatEvaluator} implementations, which can be designed to
    suit their use specific needs.</li>
  <li><strong>{@code DataSource}</strong> - ExoPlayer’s upstream package already contains a
    number of {@code DataSource} implementations for different use cases, such as writing and
    reading to and from a persistent media cache. You may want to implement you own
    {@code DataSource} class to load data in another way, such as a custom
    protocol or HTTP stack for data input.</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="custom-guidelines">Custom component guidelines</h3>

<p>If a custom component needs to report events back to the app, we recommend that you
  do so using the same model as existing ExoPlayer components, where an event listener is passed
  together with a {@link android.os.Handler} to the constructor of the component.</p>

<p>We recommended that custom components use the same model as existing ExoPlayer components to
  allow reconfiguration by the app during playback, as described in
  <a href="#sending-messages">Sending messages to components</a>.
  To do this, you should implement a {@code ExoPlayerComponent} and receive
  configuration changes in its {@code handleMessage()} method. Your app should pass
  configuration changes by calling ExoPlayer’s {@code sendMessage()} and {@code
  blockingSendMessage()} methods.</p>


<h2 id="drm">Digital Rights Management</h2>

<p>On Android 4.3 (API level 18) and higher, ExoPlayer supports Digital Rights Managment (DRM)
  protected playback. In order to play DRM protected content with ExoPlayer, your app must
  inject a {@code DrmSessionManager} into the {@code MediaCodecVideoTrackRenderer} and {@code
  MediaCodecAudioTrackRenderer} constructors. A {@code DrmSessionManager} object is responsible for
  providing the {@code MediaCrypto} object required for decryption, as well as ensuring that the
  required decryption keys are available to the underlying DRM module being used.</p>

<p>The ExoPlayer library provides a default implementation of {@code DrmSessionManager}, called
  {@code StreamingDrmSessionManager}, which uses {@link android.media.MediaDrm}. The session
  manager supports any DRM scheme for which a modular DRM component exists on the device. All
  Android devices are required to support Widevine modular DRM (with L3 security, although many
  devices also support L1). Some devices may support additional schemes such as PlayReady.</p>

<p>The {@code StreamingDrmSessionManager} class requires a {@code MediaDrmCallback} to be
  injected into its constructor, which is responsible for actually making provisioning and key
  requests. You should implement this interface to make network requests to your license
  server and obtain the required keys. The {@code WidevineTestMediaDrmCallback} class in the
  ExoPlayer demo app sends requests to a Widevine test server.</p>
