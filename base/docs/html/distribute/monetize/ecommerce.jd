<p>
  With Google Wallet Instant Buy, you've the added flexibility of selling
  physical goods and services, such as clothing or movie tickets, through your
  apps using <a href=
  "https://developers.google.com/wallet/instant-buy/">Instant Buy for
  Android</a> <strong>(US Only)</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  You can use this option where your app is the store-front for retail or
  webtail operations. However, you can also combine it with your <a href=
  "{@docRoot}distribute/monetize/premium.html">premium</a> and <a href=
  "{@docRoot}distribute/monetize/freemium.html">freemium</a> apps by offering
  related products.
</p>

<p>
  Your customers purchase goods and services with any Google Wallet payment
  method &mdash; credit card, gift card, or Wallet balance. Google Wallet
  Instant Buy helps you minimize user data entry by enabling your payment flow
  to retrieve information directly from the user’s wallet.
</p>

<p>
  You also keep your existing payment infrastructure and leverage Google Wallet
  to optimize your payment flow &mdash; users can make purchases in as a few as
  two clicks and the flow is simplified with features to retrieve information
  directly from the user’s wallet and intelligent auto-completion of addresses.
  To get started, set up a <a href=
  "{@docRoot}distribute/googleplay/start.html#merchant-account">Merchant
  Account</a>.
