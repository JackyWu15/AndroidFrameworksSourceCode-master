<p>Android Studio makes it easy to create Android apps for several form factors, such as phone,
tablet, TV, Wear, and Google Glass. The <em>New Project</em> wizard lets you choose the form factors
for your app and populates the project structure with everything you need to get started.</p>

<p>Follow the steps in this section to create a project in Android Studio.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Create a New Project</h2>

<p>If you didn't have a project opened, Android Studio shows the Welcome screen.
To create a new project, click <strong>New Project</strong>.</p>

<p>If you had a project opened, Android Studio shows the development environment.
To create a new project, click <strong>File</strong> > <strong>New Project</strong>.</p>

<p>The next window lets you configure the name of your app, the package name, and the location
of your project.</p>

<p>Enter the values for your project and click <strong>Next</strong>.</p>


<h2>Step 2: Select Form Factors and API Level</h2>

<p>The next window lets you select the form factors supported by your app, such as phone, tablet,
TV, Wear, and Google Glass. For each form factor, you can also select the API
Level that your app requires. To get more information, click <strong>Help me choose</strong>.</p>

<p>The API Level window shows the distribution of mobile devices running each version of Android,
as shown in Figure 2. Click on an API level to see a list of features introduced in the corresponding
version of Android. This helps you choose the minimum API Level that has all the features that
your apps needs, so you can reach as many devices as possible. Then click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>

<p>Then, on the Form Factors Window, click <strong>Next</strong>.</p>


<h2>Step 3: Add an Activity</h2>

<p>The next screen lets you select an activity type to add to your app, as shown in Figure 4.
This screen depends on the form factors you selected earlier.</p>

<p>Choose an activity type and click <strong>Next</strong>.</p>


<h2>Step 4: Configure Your Activity</h2>

<p>The next screen lets you configure the activity to add to your app, as shown in Figure 6.</p>

<p class="img-caption"><strong>Figure 6.</strong> Choose a name for your activity.</p>

<p>Enter the activity name, the layout name, and the activity title. Then click
<strong>Finish</strong>.</p>


<h2>Step 5: Develop Your App</h2>

<p>Android Studio creates the default structure for your project and opens the development
environment. If your app supports more than one form factor, Android Studio creates a module for
each of them, as shown in Figure 7.</p>
