  Browsing and playing media files is frequently part of the user experience provided by a TV app.
  Building such an experience from scratch, while making sure that it is fast, fluid, and attractive
  can be quite challenging. Whether your app provides access to a small or large media catalog,
  it is important to allow users to quickly browse options and get to the content they want.

  The Android framework provides classes for building user interfaces for these types of apps with
  the <a href="{@docRoot}tools/support-library/features.html#v17-leanback">v17 leanback support
  library</a>. This library provides a framework of classes for creating an efficient and familiar
  interface for browsing and playing media files with minimal coding. The classes are designed
  be extended and customized so you can create an experience that is unique to your app.
