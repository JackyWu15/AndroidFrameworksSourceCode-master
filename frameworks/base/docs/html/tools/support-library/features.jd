<p>The Android Support Library package contains several libraries that can be included
  in your application. Each of these libraries supports a specific range of Android platform
  versions and set of features.</p>

<p>This guide explains the important features and version support provided by the Support
  Libraries to help you decide which of them you should include in your application. In general,
  we recommend including the <a href="#v4">v4 support</a> and <a href="#v7-appcompat">v7
  appcompat</a> libraries, because they support a wide range of
  Android versions and provide APIs for recommended user interface patterns.</p>

<p>In order to use any of the following libraries, you must download the library files to your
  Android SDK installation. Follow the directions for downloading the Support Libraries in
  <a href="{@docRoot}tools/support-library/setup.html#download">Support Library Setup</a> to
  complete this step. You must take additional steps to include a specific Support Library in
  your application. See the end of each library section below for important information on how to
  include the library in your application.</p>
