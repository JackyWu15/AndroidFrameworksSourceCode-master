    <b>Get discovered</b>
    <p>
      With Google Play for Education, teachers and administrators can browse
      content by curriculum, grade, and standard &mdash; discovering the right

      and distribute your app to their classes in a few clicks.
    </p>

      Millions of students, faculty, and staff are using Google Apps for
      Education and other Google services. Many of these schools are excited to
      take advantage of tablets with Google Play for Education and they are
      looking to bring your apps into their classrooms, especially apps using
      Google sign-on.
    </p>

      With Google Play for Education, educators are able to make high-volume
      purchases using standard institutional payment mechanisms and then
