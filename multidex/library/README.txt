Library Project including compatibility multi dex loader.

This can be used by an Android project to install classloader
with multiple dex of applications running on API 14+.

There is technically no source, but the src folder is necessary
to ensure that the build system works.  The content is actually
located in libs/android-support-multidex.jar.
